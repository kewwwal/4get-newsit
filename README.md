newsit integration for lolcat's 4get search engine

### how to install
1. install a userscript manager like [violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/), [tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/), or similar.
2. click [here](main.user.js?raw=true) to install.

### what it does
shows reddit and hacker news discussions under your search results. so you can see what the internet thinks.

### compatibility
works on any 4get instance. it detects 4get by looking for specific page elements, so self-hosted versions should work too — haven't tested those though.

### old reddit
links go to old.reddit.com by default. if you prefer new reddit, click the tampermonkey (or similar) icon → 4get-newsit → click to toggle.

### credits
this is basically [benwinding/newsit](https://github.com/benwinding/newsit) but rewritten from scratch as a userscript for [lolcat/4get](https://git.lolcat.ca/lolcat/4get).

### note
